```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for considering Roosevelt for your project.

After reviewing your requirements, I don't think we're the best fit for this particular project. [Specific reason: timeline/budget/scope].

I'd recommend reaching out to [Referral 1] or [Referral 2] who may be better suited for your needs.

I appreciate your time and wish you success with the project.

Best,
Sam
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Client unresponsive after proposal
**Solution:**
1. Follow up after 5 business days
2. If still no response after 2 follow-ups, close lead
3. Document in CRM

**Issue:** Client wants to negotiate scope drastically
**Solution:**
1. Assess if reduced scope still interesting
2. If yes: Revise proposal
3. If no: Politely decline

**Issue:** Client wants to start before contract signed
**Solution:**
1. Never start work without signed contract
2. Explain risk and policy
3. If urgent: Expedite contract process
