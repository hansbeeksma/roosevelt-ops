## Design Principles as Quality Gates

Before any design/code change:

1. Does it follow "Architecture First"? (systematic, not ad-hoc)
2. Does it meet "Quality over Speed"? (no placeholders shipped)
3. Is it "Transparently Communicated"? (clear, not decorative)
4. Does it provide "Direct Access"? (minimal friction)
